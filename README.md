# AERO_KiCAD_Library
all custom libraries or imported parts

`CustomFootprints.pretty` has all of the component footprints (used in PCB layout)

`AERO_custom_symbols.kicad_sym` has all the custom symbols (used in schematic layout)

`3d-models' has all the custom 3d models (used in pcb view)

When managing file paths, be sure to follow the following naming convention: 

When importing the symbols library call it `AERO_Symbols`. When importing the footprint library call it `AERO_Footprints`. The 3D libary path should be called `AERO_3D`. If everyone does this, there should not be any "Cannont Find Symbol" Errors. If you encounter this when opening files, your symbol naming could be incorrect.
